## LOGD

LOGD is a website made on the MEAN stack for video game fans to review and log games they have played as well as create and share lists with other users. 

STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS! The code is frankly disgusting. But this was a project for learning and building an application that is pretty large for a single person. Will probably be moving this over to TypeScript and employing much better organization and coding in an update
